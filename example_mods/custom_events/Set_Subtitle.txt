Has a little subtitle similar to the Twinsomnia one, but coded by your's truly (volv).

Value 1:
	This is where the text of the subtitle goes, followed by a colon(:). Following the colon is a 
	name of an icon you wish to use. It then grabs that icon and displays it above the subtitle.

Value 2:
	This is just the color of the text, in #RRGGBB format. Leave blank to default it to #FFFFFF.
